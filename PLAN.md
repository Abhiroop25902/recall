# Recall: Developer Implementation Plan

This file tracks implementation work. The current architecture and package layout live
in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md); agent collaboration and Mem0 guidance live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

Recall's application interface is a stateless Streamable HTTP MCP server for OpenCode. There is no custom REST memory API;
the health endpoint is `/v1/health`, and the MCP endpoint is `/v1/mcp`.

## Day 1: Project Bootstrapping & Local Setup

**Goal:** Run the Java 25 / Spring Boot 4 application locally.

- [x] **Task 1.1: Gradle project setup**
    - Use Gradle, Java 25, Spring Boot 4.0.7, Spring Web MVC, Lombok, and DevTools.
- [x] **Task 1.2: Application entrypoint & configuration**
    - `com.abhiroop.recall.RecallApplication` is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`.
    - Use `src/main/resources/application.properties`; Spring Boot uses port 8080 by default.
- [x] **Task 1.3: Health endpoint**
    - `GET /v1/health` returns `{ "status": "UP", "service": "recall" }`.
- [x] **Verification**
  ```bash
  ./gradlew test
  ./gradlew bootRun
  curl http://localhost:8080/v1/health
  ```

---

## Day 2: Domain Model & Firestore Configuration

**Goal:** Connect to Cloud Firestore and implement basic CRUD persistence.

- [x] **Task 2.1: Add Firestore dependencies and typed configuration**
    - Add the Google Cloud libraries BOM and Firestore SDK to `build.gradle`.
    - Create `config/RecallProperties.java` using `@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "recall")` for `gcpProjectId`.
    - Defer `firestoreCollection`, Gemini properties, and authentication properties until their respective tasks require them.
- [x] **Task 2.2: Define the `Memory` domain entity**
    - Include the Firestore document `id`, required `appId` as the folder namespace, `text`, `embedding` as a native
      Firestore vector, and `createdAt`.
    - Memory changes use delete-then-create; there is no in-place update or `updatedAt` field.
    - Add a unit test rejecting null or blank `appId` values.
- [x] **Task 2.3: Firestore client and repository**
    - Add `config/FirestoreConfig.java` and a `MemoryRepository` with a Firestore-backed implementation.
    - Support save, find by id, delete by id, and listing scoped by `appId`.
- [x] **Verification**
    - Saved a test memory document through the deployed MCP server, retrieved it by `appId`, deleted it, and confirmed
      Firestore persistence in the configured project.

---

## Day 3: Stateless MCP Server & CRUD Tools

**Goal:** Provide the first usable MCP interface for OpenCode.

- [x] **Task 3.1: MCP transport**
    - Add the Spring AI WebMVC MCP server starter.
    - Set `spring.ai.mcp.server.protocol=STATELESS`; use `/v1/mcp` as the MCP endpoint.
- [x] **Task 3.2: CRUD tools**
    - Expose `saveMemory`, `getMemories`, and `deleteMemory` as Spring AI `@Tool` methods.
    - Use DTO input for MCP tools; keep the Firestore `Memory` entity inside the service/repository boundary.
    - Back the tools with the Firestore repository and preserve delete-then-create memory changes.
    - Defer `search_memories` until vector search and embeddings are available.
- [x] **Verification**
    - [x] Complete an MCP handshake and discover the registered tools locally.
    - [x] Verify local `saveMemory` MCP wiring.
    - [x] Invoke all CRUD tools against the Firestore emulator or a configured project.

---

## Day 4: Cloud Run Deployment

**Goal:** Host the stateless MCP server for OpenCode.

- [x] **Task 4.1: Single-user API-key authentication**
    - Add application-level bearer authentication for this single-user deployment.
    - Use one shared key for the owner; defer customer accounts, key registries, and per-customer authorization.
    - Resolve `RECALL_API_KEY` directly from Secret Manager through `sm@`; never commit, log, or mount the key as an environment variable.
    - Require `Authorization: Bearer <RECALL_API_KEY>` for `/v1/mcp` and return `401` for missing or invalid keys.
    - Keep `GET /v1/health` available without an API key for health checks.
    - [x] Add tests for missing, invalid, and valid credentials before deployment.
- [x] **Task 4.2: Managed deployment**
    - Deploy through the configured Cloud Build GitHub push trigger; the Cloud Run Java buildpack builds and runs the application.
    - Store `RECALL_API_KEY` in Secret Manager and grant the Cloud Run runtime service account access to resolve it directly.
    - Use Cloud Run public access intentionally; the application-level API-key filter protects `/v1/mcp`.
    - Grant the runtime service account only the Firestore and Secret Manager permissions it needs.
- [x] **Verification**
    - [x] Confirm `GET /v1/health` is public at `https://recall-768264222351.asia-south1.run.app`.
    - [x] Confirm deployed `/v1/mcp` returns `401` for missing and invalid bearer keys.
    - [x] Complete an authenticated MCP handshake and CRUD tool calls against the deployed `/v1/mcp` endpoint.

## Day 5: Firestore Vector Similarity Search

**Goal:** Implement scoped vector similarity search using Firestore native vector queries.

Save-time embedding generation is complete as a prerequisite; query embedding generation remains part of Day 6.

- [ ] **Task 5.1: Repository contract**
    - Add `searchSimilar(String appId, List<Double> queryVector, int topK, double threshold)`.
- [ ] **Task 5.2: Firestore query**
    - Use the `appId` filter before the nearest-neighbor query and rank by cosine distance.
- [ ] **Task 5.3: Result mapping**
    - Add `MemorySearchResult` and filter results below the requested threshold.
- [ ] **Verification**
    - Query with a dummy 1536-dimensional vector and confirm scoped, ranked results.

---

## Day 6: Gemini Text Embeddings Client

**Goal:** Convert memory text and search queries into embeddings.

- [x] **Task 6.1: Spring AI Gemini embedding model**
    - Configure the Google GenAI embedding starter with the project, global location, model, and 1536 output dimensions.
- [x] **Task 6.2: Save-time embedding creation**
    - Generate an embedding for each `saveMemory` request and persist it as a Firestore `VectorValue`.
- [ ] **Task 6.3: Search integration**
    - Combine embedding generation and vector search in `MemoryService.search(...)`.
- [x] **Verification**
    - Unit test embedding-to-Firestore-vector conversion during memory creation.
- [x] **Live verification**
    - Confirmed deployed `saveMemory` persists a Firestore vector; `getMemories` retrieved the test record by `appId` and `deleteMemory` removed it.

---

## Day 7: Gemini Fact Extraction & Deduplication

**Goal:** Extract atomic facts and resolve duplicates or contradictions.

- [ ] **Task 7.1: Extraction contract**
    - Add an `ExtractedFact` record and prompt template for category, text, and confidence.
- [ ] **Task 7.2: LLM extraction**
    - Implement structured JSON fact extraction in `GeminiClient`.
- [ ] **Task 7.3: Memory engine**
    - Search comparable memories, choose ADD, DELETE, or NOOP; replace stale memories with delete then create.
- [ ] **Verification**
    - Process a multi-turn conversation and confirm clean fact storage without duplicates.

---

## Day 8: OpenCode Integration & Cross-Device Verification

**Goal:** Connect coding agents to the deployed memory service.

- [ ] **Task 8.1: MCP client configuration**
    - Document the deployed `/v1/mcp` URL and authentication setup without committing credentials.
- [ ] **Task 8.2: End-to-end verification**
    - Store a memory from one client and retrieve it from another environment.

## Completion criteria

The project is complete when the deployed service accepts authenticated MCP tool calls from OpenCode, persists and searches
scoped memories, and passes end-to-end retrieval from a separate client.
